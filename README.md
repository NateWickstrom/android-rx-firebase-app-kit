Work in progress for building a bunch of reusable app components that leveraging Firebase and Algolia to create a baseline of key app components.

Components needed by (almost) every App:
----------------------------------------
- Authorization, such as a Login, Signup, and Forgot Password screen
- User Profiles, one such for the logged in (current) user and another for others, i.e. not theirs
- Search, as a way to browse users and content, whatever it may be
- Social Connections, such as connecting, disconnecting, and blocking social connection within the platform
- Messaging, such as direct messaging or messages attached to a piece of content, such as comments on a 'post'
- Notification, such as social or messaging related
